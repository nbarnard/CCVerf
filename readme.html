<p><font size=+1>What CCVerf is:</font>
<ul>
<li>
CCVerf is a ANSI C function that checks the mathamatical accuracy of
major credit card numbers.</li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>What CCVerf does:</font>
<ul>
<li>
Check the mathematical accuracy of the card number against the MOD10 algorithm.</li>

<li>
Check if the card number fits the format for the brand of the credit card.
(i.e. Visa, Master Card, American Express and Discover)</li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>What CCVerf does not do:</font>
<ul>
<li>
Check the actual validly of a card number with a bank.</li>

<li>
Check the balance available on the card number in question.</li>

<li>
Check the expiration date of the card number in question.</li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>Why CCVerf is useful:</font>
<ul>
<li>
Reduce verification costs related to per verification costs, or related
connection costs.</li>

<li>
Provide a simple method for off-line verification.</li>

<li>
Reduce customer wait time while credit card numbers are checked versus
the credit card network, just to get a response that the card number is
invalid.</li>

<li>
Is just an interesting study in basic security and structure methods.</li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>What CCVerf accepts at its arguments (inputs):</font>
<ul>
<li>
A string, which is accessed via pointer, which contains the card number
in question.&nbsp; This string may contain extraneous non numerical characters,
that CCVerf will ignore.</li>

<li>
A integer between one and four, which corresponds to the card type, as
stated by the chart below:</li>
</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=0 >
<tr>
<td>Integer Input</td>

<td>Corresponding Card Type</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=RIGHT>1 -&nbsp;</td>

<td>Visa</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=RIGHT>2 -&nbsp;</td>

<td>Master Card</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=RIGHT>3 -&nbsp;</td>

<td>American Express/Diner's Club</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=RIGHT>4 -&nbsp;</td>

<td>Discover</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>
<font size=+1>How CCVerf checks the credit card number:</font>
<ul>
<li>
First, CCVerf strips out all the non numeric characters and checks the
number of digits.&nbsp; If number of digits isn't 13, 15, or 16 it rejects
the card.</li>

<li>
Second, CCVerf checks the length of the number versus the type.&nbsp; Visa
cards numbers must be 13 or 16 digits.&nbsp; American Express card numbers
must be 15 digits.&nbsp; Master Card and Discover card numbers must be
16 digits.</li>

<li>
Third, CCVerf checks the first digit of the card number versus the type.&nbsp;
American Express card numbers must start with '3'.&nbsp; Visa card numbers
must start with '4'.&nbsp; Master Card numbers must start with '5'.&nbsp;
Discover card numbers must start with '6'.</li>

<li>
Finally, CCVerf checks the card number versus the MOD10 algorithm. The
MOD10 algorithm works by utilizing a single digit doubling system on every
other digit starting on the first digit on sixteen digit cards, and on
the second digit on thirteen and fifteen digit cards.&nbsp;&nbsp; [i.e.
five doubles into one. (5x2 = 10, 1+0=1)&nbsp; Eight doubles into seven.&nbsp;
(8x2=16, 1+6=7)&nbsp; Four doubles into eight. (4x2=8, 0+8=8)]&nbsp; Next,
the MOD10 algorithm adds the resulting doubled digits together and verifies
the result is divisible by ten.</li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>An example of how CCVerf checks the credit card number:</font>
<br>The string "4191-0600-2310-2329" and the integer '1' is passed to CCVerf.&nbsp;
CCVerf starts by pulling all of the numerical digits out of the string
and placing them in a array, represented by following table:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 >
<tr>
<td>Array Position</td>

<td>00</td>

<td>01</td>

<td>02</td>

<td>03</td>

<td>04</td>

<td>05</td>

<td>06</td>

<td>07</td>

<td>08</td>

<td>09</td>

<td>10</td>

<td>11</td>

<td>12</td>

<td>13</td>

<td>14</td>

<td>15</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Digit Contained</td>

<td>4</td>

<td>7</td>

<td>9</td>

<td>1</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>6</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>2</td>

<td>3</td>

<td>1</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>2</td>

<td>3</td>

<td>2</td>

<td>9</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>CCVerf first checks and sees that the length of the card is sixteen
digits, an acceptable length for a card number.&nbsp; It then checks the
digit in array position zero and confirms that the first digit is four,
since this card was reported as a Visa.&nbsp; CCVerf then doubles every
other digit of the array starting at the 00 array position and replaces
the original digit with the doubled digit.&nbsp; Leaving the array in the
following state:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 >
<tr>
<td>Array Position</td>

<td>00</td>

<td>01</td>

<td>02</td>

<td>03</td>

<td>04</td>

<td>05</td>

<td>06</td>

<td>07</td>

<td>08</td>

<td>09</td>

<td>10</td>

<td>11</td>

<td>12</td>

<td>13</td>

<td>14</td>

<td>15</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Digit Contained</td>

<td>8</td>

<td>7</td>

<td>9</td>

<td>1</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>6</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>4</td>

<td>3</td>

<td>2</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>4</td>

<td>3</td>

<td>4</td>

<td>9</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When the digits are added the total is sixty, since sixty is divisible
by ten, and the card has passed all the other requirements the card is
considered valid.
